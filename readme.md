My First Portfolio Project
This portfolio was built while I was attending NPower coding.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and a hint of PHP

For this class project, I had to use bootstrap, so I found a template that I liked and began modifying it to fit my needs for this project. Pretty much getting rid of the things I don't like and keeping the things I do. Changed the HTML to fit my information. Gathered different images and stock photos using photoshop to convert them for optimal web use. Customized some JavaScript components to add subtle interaction to the site.

Optimizations
Definitely needs more interactive features and a blog page.

Lessons Learned:
Bootstrap is a great way to start a site. All you have to do is add it and plug in play. One thing I did learn is that gathering photos 'that you can legally use' and optimizing them for the web is a very long and tedious process but pays dividends in the long run. This site helped me learn how to piece everything together for a finished project, and how much better it is to start with a template.
